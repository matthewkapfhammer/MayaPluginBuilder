I created a cookiecutter, but it doesn't work, and I can't figure out why
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Try upgrading to Cookiecutter 0.8.0, which prints better error
  messages and has fixes for several common bugs.

I'm having trouble generating Jinja templates from Jinja templates
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you escape things properly, like this::

    {{ "{{" }}

Or this::

    {% raw %}
    <p>Go <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Home</a></p>
    {% endraw %}

Or this::

    {{ {{ url_for('home') }} }}

See http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#escaping for more info.

You can also use the `copy_without_render`_ key in your `cookiecutter.json`
file to escape entire files and directories.
