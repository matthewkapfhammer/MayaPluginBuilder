Pull Request Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and PyPy on Appveyor and Travis CI.
4. Check https://travis-ci.org/audreyr/cookiecutter/pull_requests and 
   https://ci.appveyor.com/project/audreyr/cookiecutter/history to ensure the tests pass for all supported Python versions and platforms.

Coding Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* PEP8
* Functions over classes except in tests
* Quotes via http://stackoverflow.com/a/56190/5549
  * Use double quotes around strings that are used for interpolation or that are natural language messages
  * Use single quotes for small symbol-like strings (but break the rules if the strings contain quotes)
  * Use triple double quotes for docstrings and raw string literals for regular expressions even if they aren't needed.
  * Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        LIGHT_MESSAGES = {
            'English': "There are %(number_of_lights)s lights.",
            'Pirate':  "Arr! Thar be %(number_of_lights)s lights."
        }

        def lights_message(language, number_of_lights):
            """Return a language-appropriate string reporting the light count."""
            return LIGHT_MESSAGES[language] % locals()

        def is_pirate(message):
            """Return True if the given message sounds piratical."""
            return re.search(r"(?i)(arr|avast|yohoho)!", message) is not None

  * Write new code in Python 3.
