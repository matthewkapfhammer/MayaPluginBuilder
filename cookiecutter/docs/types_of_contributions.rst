Types of Contributions
----------------------

You can contribute in many ways:

Create Cookiecutter Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some other Cookiecutter templates to list in the :ref:`README <readme>` would
be great.

If you create a Cookiecutter template, submit a pull request adding it to
README.rst.

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* If you can, provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
* If you don't have steps to reproduce the bug, just note your observations in
  as much detail as you can. Questions to start a discussion about the issue
  are welcome.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Please do not combine multiple feature enhancements into a single pull request.

Note: this project is a bit conservative, so new features might not get into core.
If possible, it's best to try and implement feature ideas as separate projects
outside of the core codebase.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cookiecutter could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Cookiecutter docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
